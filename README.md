# CURSIVE CLASSIFIER

A program that recognizes cursive handwriting and converts it into text.

## Prelogue

In 2010, at the age of 8, I was being taught how to write in cursive. 

In 2019, at the age of 18, while walking in San Francisco, climbing up California street, I stumbled upon a driverless Uber car. I was spoonfed Python. 

In the Fall of 2023, I enrolled in Data Science courses at UCF. After learning that my Data Science instructor was going to force us to learn 3 programming languages, from which I only knew Python. I decided I was better off remaining in Data Science and Statistics 2 and withdrew from the rest. It was a smart move, if I would've stayed in all four, I wouldn't have gotten straight As.

On January 7, 2025, Jensen Huang unveiled Project DIGITS. A personal AI supercomputer that can fit on your desk. I want one, I'll probably buy it with crypto, once I make up my mind. Now is the time to take machine learning seriously.

## Languages

The project will be implemented three times. Python, Julia, and R. Just for fun.
